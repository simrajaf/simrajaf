Hi! My name is Simra Jaffery, and Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. Iâ€™m passionate about technology and have hands-on experience using Python, as well as Javaâ€”especially when it comes to game development. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and am currently working on a project to dive deeper into the world of machine learning.

When Iâ€™m not coding or working on school projects, youâ€™ll probably find me painting or crocheting, as I love expressing my creativity. I also run a small design business where I create custom merch and art commissions for small businesses and creators on social media. Connecting with people through art and tech is something I truly enjoy!

Iâ€™m always looking for new opportunities to grow, collaborate, and learnâ€”whether itâ€™s through building new projects, helping others, or exploring new creative outlets.
